Error[e16]: Segment NEAR_Z (size: 0x41b align: 0) is too long for segment definition. At least 0xf8 more bytes needed. The problem occurred while processing the segment placement command "-Z(DATA)NEAR_I,NEAR_Z,NEAR_N=_..X_SRAM_BASE-_..X_SRAM_END", where at the moment of placement the available memory ranges were "DATA:1dd-4ff"
   Reserved ranges relevant to this placement:
   DATA:100-13f         CSTACK
   DATA:140-15f         RSTACK
   DATA:160-4ff         NEAR_I
